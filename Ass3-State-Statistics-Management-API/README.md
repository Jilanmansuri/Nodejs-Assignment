# 📊 Initial State Data

The API starts with predefined Indian states stored in an in-memory array.

State structure:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Gujarat",
  population: 63872399,
  literacyRate: 78.03,
  annualBudget: 243965,
  gdp: 21000000
}
```

# 🧠 Concepts Used

- Express Routing  
- Middleware (`express.json()`, `cors()`)  
- Route Parameters  
- Array Methods (`find()`, `findIndex()`, `reduce()`, `filter()`)  
- PUT vs PATCH Difference  
- HTTP Status Codes  
- In-Memory Data Handling
